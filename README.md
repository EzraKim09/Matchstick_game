Sup, peeps! 🎮 Check out this super basic game I made during my 1st semester of college. 📚 Later on, I jazzed up the UI and made it more playable while also fixing some tricky edge cases. 🛠️ My main goal is to boost my GitHub activity, so I'll be dropping simple codes like this more often. 😎

I really tried to make the game user-friendly, but ngl, you ain't ever gonna win. 😅💔
